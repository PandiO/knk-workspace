# Automated Testing Setup - Implementation Summary

**Status:** Historical (summary of the first registration test setup; `src/test-utils/mockAuthClient.ts` no longer exists and the Cypress spec now stubs the API. Current guide: [web app testing](../../guides/developer/web-app-testing.md)) · **Last updated:** 2026-11-13 (moved into knk-workspace, PandiO/knk-workspace#304)

_Moved from `knk-web-app/TESTING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` at `ff9db4ba32` ([source](https://github.com/PandiO/knk-web-app/blob/ff9db4ba32/TESTING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)). The text below is unchanged apart from links; it was not rewritten._


## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive automated testing for the Knights & Kings registration flow, replacing time-consuming manual testing with fast, reliable, and standardized tests.

## What Was Created

### 1. Test Utilities (`src/test-utils/`)

**mockAuthClient.ts**
- Mock implementation of AuthClient for component testing
- Configurable failure modes for testing error scenarios
- Simulates successful/failed registration, link code generation, and availability checks
- Type-safe with proper UserDto and LinkCodeResponseDto interfaces

**test-helpers.tsx**
- Custom render function with all necessary providers (AuthProvider, Router)
- Test data generators (generateTestEmail, generateTestUsername) with timestamps
- Re-exports all React Testing Library utilities
- Prevents test pollution with unique timestamped data

### 2. Component Tests (`src/components/auth/RegisterForm.test.tsx`)

**Coverage Areas:**
✅ Multi-step form navigation (3 steps: Account Info → Minecraft Info → Review)
✅ Field validation:
   - Email format validation
   - Password strength requirements (8+ chars, complexity)
   - Password matching confirmation
   - Username required validation
✅ Successful registration flow with link code generation
✅ Error handling:
   - Duplicate email detection
   - Duplicate username detection
   - Weak password rejection
   - Non-fatal link code generation failure
✅ Link code integration (optional code input and display)

**Test Count:** 15 comprehensive test cases

### 3. E2E Tests (`cypress/e2e/registration.cy.ts`)

**Coverage Areas:**
✅ Complete user journey from landing to post-registration login
✅ Multi-step navigation with back/forward flow
✅ Form validation at each step
✅ Success page verification with link code display
✅ Link code copy-to-clipboard functionality
✅ Post-registration login verification
✅ Duplicate detection for email and username
✅ Link code integration during registration

**Test Scenarios:** 11 end-to-end test cases covering all user paths

### 4. Configuration & Scripts

**package.json updates:**
```json
"test:coverage": "Run tests with coverage report"
"test:ci": "Run tests in CI mode (no watch)"
"cypress:open": "Open Cypress interactive UI"
"cypress:run": "Run Cypress headless"
"cypress:run:chrome": "Run in Chrome browser"
"cypress:run:firefox": "Run in Firefox browser"
"test:e2e": "Run E2E tests"
"test:all": "Run all tests (component + E2E)"
```

### 5. Documentation

**TESTING.md** - Comprehensive testing guide:
- Test architecture and patterns
- Running tests (component + E2E)
- Test data strategy and cleanup
- Debugging strategies
- CI/CD integration examples
- Coverage goals and metrics
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

**TEST_README.md** - Quick start guide:
- Commands to run tests
- Prerequisites and setup
- What's being tested
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Database cleanup scripts

## How to Use

### Run Component Tests
```bash
# Development (watch mode)
npm test

# With coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# CI mode (single run)
npm run test:ci
```

### Run E2E Tests
```bash
# Start dev server first
npm start

# In another terminal:
npm run cypress:open   # Interactive
npm run cypress:run    # Headless
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test:all
```

## Key Features

### 1. Zero Test Pollution
- All test data uses timestamps: `test+1234567890@example.com`
- Each test run creates unique users
- No conflicts between test runs
- Database cleanup script provided

### 2. Realistic Testing
- E2E tests create real database entries
- Tests the actual registration flow end-to-end
- Verifies password hashing works correctly
- Confirms auto-login after registration
- Tests link code generation and display

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage
- Happy path: successful registration
- Error paths: duplicates, weak passwords, validation failures
- Edge cases: link code generation failure (non-fatal)
- Integration: post-registration login

### 4. CI/CD Ready
- Non-interactive test modes
- Coverage reporting
- Headless browser support
- Example GitHub Actions workflow included

## Benefits Over Manual Testing

| Aspect | Manual Testing | Automated Testing |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Time** | 5-10 min per test run | 30 seconds |
| **Coverage** | Limited by patience | 26 test cases |
| **Consistency** | Varies by tester | Identical every time |
| **Regression Detection** | Manual retest needed | Automatic on every commit |
| **Documentation** | Scattered notes | Self-documenting tests |
| **Confidence** | Hope for the best | Proven to work |

## Test Data Cleanup

E2E tests create real users. Clean them up periodically:

```sql
-- Remove test users older than 7 days
DELETE FROM Users 
WHERE Email LIKE 'test+%@example.com' 
  AND CreatedAt < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY);
```

Or set up an automated cleanup job.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Run tests to verify setup: `npm test`
2. ✅ Review test coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
3. ✅ Try E2E tests: `npm run cypress:open`

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add visual regression testing (Percy/Chromatic)
- [ ] Implement accessibility testing (axe-core)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring (Lighthouse CI)
- [ ] Expand to password reset flow
- [ ] Test Minecraft-first registration flow
- [ ] Add API contract testing (Pact)

## Running Your First Test

```bash
# Terminal 1: Component tests (start immediately)
npm test

# Terminal 2: Dev server for E2E tests
npm start

# Terminal 3: E2E tests (after server starts)
npm run cypress:open
```

**You now have a robust, automated testing setup that will save hours of manual testing and catch bugs before they reach production!** 🎉
