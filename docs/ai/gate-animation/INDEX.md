## 🔑 Key Design Decisions (Already Made)

✅ **Gate Types: SLIDING, TRAP, DRAWBRIDGE, DOUBLE_DOORS** (v1 - extensible for v2)  
✅ **Geometry Modes: PLANE_GRID, FLOOD_FILL** (automatic or manual block selection)  
✅ **Diagonal Support: Full support** (FaceDirection: 8 cardinal/diagonal directions)  
✅ **Motion Types: VERTICAL, LATERAL, ROTATION** (deterministic, server-tick based)  
✅ **Block Storage: GateBlockSnapshot entity** (one-to-many with GateStructure)  
✅ **Animation: Runtime frame calculation** (no stored frames, precomputed data)  
✅ **Entity Push: Collision prediction** (push only when collision imminent, not premature)  
✅ **State Machine: CLOSED, OPENING, OPEN, CLOSING, JAMMED, BROKEN** (persisted: IsOpened only)  
✅ **Health & Respawn: Auto-repair after RespawnRateSeconds** (default 300s = 5 min)  
✅ **WorldGuard Integration: Dual regions** (RegionClosedId, RegionOpenedId)  
✅ **Performance Target: ~100 gates, 20 TPS with 10 animating** (lazy updates, batched chunks)  
✅ **Tile Entity Policy: DECORATIVE_ONLY (v1)** (no inventory tile entities)

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Where do I start?**  
A: Read [REQUIREMENTS_GATE_ANIMATION.md](../../specs/gate-structure/REQUIREMENTS_GATE_ANIMATION.md) first (60-90 min), then decide if you need the quick start or full roadmap.

**Q: What's the difference between PLANE_GRID and FLOOD_FILL?**  
A: PLANE_GRID is for rectangular gates (portcullis, drawbridge) using 3 reference points. FLOOD_FILL is for irregular shapes (double doors, decorative gates) using seed blocks and BFS.

**Q: How are diagonal gates handled?**  
A: PLANE_GRID mode constructs a local coordinate system (u, v, n) from the 3 reference points. This system automatically handles diagonal orientation. Blocks are placed along these local axes, not world axes.

**Q: How does the animation work?**  
A: Frames are calculated at runtime (not stored). Each tick, the plugin:
1. Checks gates in OPENING/CLOSING state
2. Calculates current frame based on elapsed ticks
3. Computes block positions using linear interpolation (VERTICAL/LATERAL) or rotation (DRAWBRIDGE)
4. Places/removes blocks at calculated positions
5. Predicts entity collisions and pushes entities if needed

**Q: How are performance targets met?**  
A: 
- Lazy updates (only OPENING/CLOSING gates update per tick)
- Precomputed data (local basis, motion vectors)
- Batched chunk updates (reduce lighting recalculations)
- Chunk loading checks (skip if unloaded)
- Frame skip on lag (jump to final position if TPS < 15)

**Q: What's the migration path for existing gates?**  
A: Database schema update → backfill existing gates (admin configures geometry) → deploy plugin update → test & validate. Rollback: disable IsActive or revert plugin.

**Q: How do I test diagonal gates?**  
A: Create a gate with FaceDirection="north-east" and set ReferencePoint1 diagonally from AnchorPoint (e.g., p0={100,64,100}, p1={105,64,95}). Verify blocks animate along diagonal axis.

**Q: What's the difference between HealthCurrent and IsDestroyed?**  
A: HealthCurrent is the current HP (0 to HealthMax). IsDestroyed is set to true when HealthCurrent reaches 0, triggering respawn logic if CanRespawn=true.

**Q: Can gates have different open/close speeds?**  
A: Yes. AnimationDurationTicks controls total animation length (default 60 ticks = 3 seconds). AnimationTickRate controls frames per tick (1 = every tick, 2 = every other tick).

**Q: How do I create a drawbridge vs. a portcullis?**  
A: Drawbridge: GateType=DRAWBRIDGE, MotionType=ROTATION, GeometryDefinitionMode=PLANE_GRID. Portcullis: GateType=SLIDING, MotionType=VERTICAL, GeometryDefinitionMode=PLANE_GRID.

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Critical Paths:**
1. Backend entity extensions must be completed before frontend UI
2. Plugin development depends on backend API completion
3. Snapshot capture logic requires MinecraftBlockRef integration
4. WorldGuard integration requires region management understanding

**Dependencies:**
- MinecraftBlockRef entity (existing)
- MinecraftMaterialRef entity (existing)
- Structure entity (existing - GateStructure extends this)
- Domain/District/Street entities (existing)
- WorldGuard plugin (external - Paper API)

**Risk Areas:**
- Diagonal gate geometry calculation (complex math)
- Block collision during rotation (stable sort order critical)
- Entity push prediction (performance impact)
- Server restart mid-animation (state recovery)
- Fluid/gravity physics during animation (side effects)

**Testing Priorities:**
1. Basic open/close (SLIDING, PLANE_GRID)
2. Diagonal gates (all 8 directions)
3. Rotation (DRAWBRIDGE, DOUBLE_DOORS)
4. Entity push (collision prediction)
5. Performance (100 gates, 10 animating)
6. Edge cases (chunk unload, server restart, block break)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Functional:**
- ✅ All 4 gate types (SLIDING, TRAP, DRAWBRIDGE, DOUBLE_DOORS) work correctly
- ✅ Diagonal gates (all 8 FaceDirection values) animate correctly
- ✅ Block snapshots captured and restored accurately
- ✅ Entity push occurs only when collision imminent (not premature)
- ✅ Health & respawn system functional
- ✅ WorldGuard integration working (dual regions)

- ✅ 10 gates animating simultaneously: TPS ≥ 18
- ✅ 20 gates animating simultaneously: TPS ≥ 15
- ✅ No server crash under stress

**Quality:**
- ✅ All unit tests passing (backend, frontend, plugin)
- ✅ Integration tests passing (API ↔ plugin sync)
- ✅ Edge cases handled (chunk unload, server restart, etc.)
- ✅ Documentation complete and accurate
