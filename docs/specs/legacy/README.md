# spec/legacy/

Source-driven inventory and analysis of the legacy `knk` codebase.

## Purpose
Document actual code patterns, entities, and migrations from legacy to avoid speculation and hallucination.

## Contents
- `SOURCES_*.md`: Verified field/entity inventories (e.g., SOURCES_TOWNS.md)
- Subsystem-specific source analyses (e.g., Economy, Guilds, Creation)
- Migration patterns and anti-patterns identified

## Principles
- **Verbatim only:** All fields/relations extracted directly from source code.
- **Annotated:** Include ORM/framework dependencies (Hibernate, Bukkit, etc.).
- **Marked gaps:** Flag missing concepts as "NOT FOUND" with search terms.
- **No invention:** Never add fields or flows not present in code.

## Audience
Migration engineers, architects, and decision-makers validating v2 design against reality.
